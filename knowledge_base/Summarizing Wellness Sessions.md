# Wellness
There is no shortcut that will replace sitting and thinking about things.
## General tips
Check in with yourself before or while engaging in habitual behaviors:
- Eating - are you actually hungry?
- YouTube - will this distract me?
- Rocket League - have I earned this?
Create smaller, more focused goals over shorter time periods that will make progress toward larger goals.
Replace bad habits with literally anything else. e.g. eat a banana every time I want to watch YT.
Look at issues as an opportunity to practice what I've been working on.
Use alarms to enforce habits I want to keep on top of.
Keep todo lists small and manageable. Tackle the hardest task first.
Sleep, diet, and exercise are the foundation to feeling better.
Try meditating.
Try CBD.
Track progress somehow.
Routines help. Especially when they include socialization, mindfulness, and time outside.
Reward myself for completing what needs to be done.
Visualize how good it will feel when I have completed the task.
