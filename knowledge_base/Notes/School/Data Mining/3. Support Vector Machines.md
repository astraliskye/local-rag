Linear classifier
Binary classifier
Assumes data can be separated by a line/plane/hyperplane
Feature space: coordinate space with axes for all features
There are infinite solutions when one exists
Generates a line that _maximally_ separates the two classes
- Generate a line that separates the two classes
- Find the data point(s) in each class that are closest to the line
- Maximize a + b, where a is the distance of the closest point of class 1 and b is the closest point of class 2
- The slope of the line is a component of the support vector
# Training
Find w and b
$$
min_{w, b} \frac{||w||^2}{2}
$$
Such that
$$
y_i(w\cdot x_i + b) \ge 1, i=1,2,... N
$$
