# Instance-Based Classifiers
Feature space: spatial representation of data objects where each axis corresponds to a feature
## Rote-learner
Memorizes training data. Only classifies new records if it matches exactly some previously seen record
## Nearest Neighbor
Uses k "closest" points for performing classification. If there are an equal number of different classes in that set of points, the tie is broken by which set of points is closer
